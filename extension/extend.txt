My extension follows the same structure as my basic

I've added chained hashing to make searching the boards quicker

I've also included the ability to find vertically mirrored solutions and print the mirrored version as the solution

As a warning, don't try searching for anything on the top row, as this has been slowing my computer down a lot

It's quite a bit quicker for the second row now though
